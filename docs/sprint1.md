# Sprint 1

## Overview

This sprint we will:
* focus on **Read**
* connect our _partially_ pre-built front-end to a back-end with hard-coded data.
* replace the hard-coded data with data stored in a mongo db


## Step 0:

Now would be a great time to explore the files provided for you.  In particular note:
* the html in public/index.html
* the incomplete server in server.js
* the included package.json

### Working through the lab

Use `nodemon` or `node server.js` throughout the exercise to run your server.  
Continually verify that your browser console is displaying the `app.js loaded!` message on document-ready.

## Step 1:
**Goal** display hard-coded data from `app.js` on `index.html`
Let's start on the outside and work our way in.  

1. Open `index.html` and find the HTML for an **album**. Convert this into a handlebars template by adding the correct script tags.  Make sure you remove the data and place appropriate attribute placeholders in place instead.  (You can get those attributes from the array of objects provided in `app.js`)  Leave `div.albums` in place.

1. Open `app.js` and edit the function `renderAlbum` to display one Album on the page.  Use the handlebars template.  

1. Run the function on document-ready and give it `sampleAlbums[0]` (just one album).  Verify that the page looks right.

<details><summary>hint: calling renderAlbum</summary>

```js
$(document).ready(function() {
  console.log('app.js loaded!');
  renderAlbum(sampleAlbums[0]);
});
```
</details>


## Step 1.5: rendering all the albums

1. Update your code to use **all** the sampleAlbums.  Use `forEach` to loop over each album in the array and use the template to put it on the page.  

  > Note that we could use the templates `#each` method and pass it all the albums at once. However, we're planning to be able to add individual albums later on, so we'll need the ability to render each album individually.  Having two separate render functions and templates (1 for individual albums, 1 for all albums) seems excessive at this point.  


At this point you should see all 4 hard-coded albums rendered on page.

<details><summary>Rendering all the albums with handlebars</summary>

```js
$(document).ready(function() {
  console.log('app.js loaded!');
  $.get('/api/albums').success(function (albums) {
    albums.forEach(function(album) {
      renderAlbum(album);
    });
  });
});


// this function takes a single album and renders it to the page
function renderAlbum(album) {
  console.log('rendering album', album);
  var albumHtml = $('#album-template').html();
  var albumsTemplate = Handlebars.compile(albumHtml);
  var html = albumsTemplate(album);
  $('#albums').prepend(html);
}
```
</details>

## Step 2:

We're going to add the following _index_ route on our server:

```
GET /api/albums
```

To better organize this app we're going to be using controllers to separate out logic for different `resources`.  That means that when you create a route like `/api/albums/:id` you'll put the server code to handle that in a separate file; and reference it's function.  [Example](controllers_example.md).  If you take a look in `server.js` you'll see that we've already required the controllers for you.

1. Open server.js and create a new route for `/api/albums`.  This route's callback should point to `controllers.albums.index`.

1. Open `controllers/albums.js` and fill in the index function to return all albums.

1. Serve the hard-coded albums in albums.js on `/api/albums`.  This is an API route, so let's send JSON.

1. In `app.js`, use `ajax` to get the albums.  Render them on the page.

1. You can safely delete the hard-coded data in `app.js` now!

> The data in `albums.js` and `app.js` is different; making it easy to see which data is being rendered on your page.


## Step 3:

Let's setup the database now.

1. Use `npm` to install `mongoose`.

1. In `models/album.js` add a model for our albums.  You should be able to determine the datatypes based on the sample data we've been using.

1. Export Album in `models/album.js`

1. Require and export Album in `models/index.js`


<details><summary>hint: `models/albums.js`</summary>

```js
//models/album.js
var AlbumSchema = new Schema({
  artistName: String,
  name: String,
  releaseDate: String,
  genres: [ String ]
});

var Album = mongoose.model('Album', AlbumSchema);

module.exports = Album;
```

</details>

<details><summary>hint: `models/index.js`</summary>

```js
module.exports.Album = require("./album.js");
```

</details>


## Step 4

Let's try seeding our database.

1. Move the hard-coded model data from `server.js` into `seed.js`.  You'll note there's already an empty variable there for you to use.  

1. Strip out the pre-coded `_id` properties, mongo will take of creating these for us.

1. Make sure `mongod` is running in a terminal.

1. Run node seed.js

1. Resolve any errors you encounter.

<details><summary>hint: `error connect ECONNREFUSED`</summary>
If you see an error like:

```
process.nextTick(function() { throw err; })
                              ^
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017
```

It usually means that `mongod` is not running.
</details>


## Step 5:

Now that the database is seeded, let's continue and use it in our `/api/albums` route.

1. Delete the hard-coded server data.

1. Require `./models` in `controllers/albums.js`.

1. Edit the current `function index` to access the database and pull all albums.

1. Verify that you're getting the right data on your index page now.  Your ajax should still work; but if the `keys` in the data have changed at all you'll have to resolve that.

<details><summary>hint: requiring `./models`</summary>

```js
var db = require('./models');
```
</details>

## Sprint 1 Conclusion

**If you're stuck, take a look at the solutions branch**

If you've made it this far then we've created an API that has an index route `/api/albums`.
Our app has a single-page view that makes an ajax GET request to the API and renders the information.  Our data is being **R**ead from the database by the server.

We've completed the **Read** component of our **CRUD** app for the moment.

**Good job!**
